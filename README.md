# How does it work?

1. Add .feature files under features folder ( if you have any other format, you can modify .eleventy.js )
2. Run the command below

```
> npx @11ty/eleventy
```
This will generate text files in dist folder (as of December 2024, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) does not support .feature file)
